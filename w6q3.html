        In javascript, each variable has a memory location and a placeholder that holds the value of the variable.<br>
        <b><u>Undefined Variables: </u></b>
        So, if a varible is created, and is not given a value, then such variable is called undefined.<br>
        In these variables, the placeholder has the keyword undefined.<br>
        Which means that whenever we try to print out the variable, it shows undefined.<br>
        <b><u>Not defined variables: </u></b>
        If a variable isn't created in javascript, and we try to print out the variable, <br>
        Then we get an error in the debug console called the specific variable is not defined.<br>
        It means that, when we try to print out the variable that is not even created, <br>
        Then it is called not-defined variable.<br>
        Check out the following javascript output...
    </p>
    <script src = "https://kavya-sri-1234.github.io/githubTest/q3.js"></script>
    <p>
        The execution of that javascript has been stopped in between due to an error.<br>
        It's because we tried to print out the variable that doesn't exist, i.e. a not-defined variable.<br>
        That lead to a compile error and the execution has been stopped in middle.<br>
